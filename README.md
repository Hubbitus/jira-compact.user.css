# jira-compact.user.css
Css styles to compact jira (>=6.1) representation. For example to use with Stylish Chromium and Firefox extension

Any feedback welcome!

## How to use
For Chrome/Chromium browswers I use it in nice [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=ru) extension.
I have not tested, but should work in [Firefox Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/stylish/) variant too (please let me known if it is not true).

Installation should be easy: Just hit button "Create style" and copy/paste content of file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hubbitus/jira-compact.user.css/master/jira-compact.user.css.
Unfortunately I do not known if there present auto installation or check to updates (so, just return from time to time to changes).

## What it is

I use Jira in my day job. It very good famous and extensible bug tracker. But even I use wide monitor additionally to notebook their design seems to me very sprawling.

That style was born several month when I tried there and there reduce elements and spaces beetween, move description right, highlight title and key fields like statusâ€¦

As it style 100 words have worth less than example looks (for simplicity and easy distinguishing I will show screenshots of original Jira in Firefox and in Chromium with that style applied)


### Screenshots

1) Jira 3 column dashboard (aaa layout):
![Original jira 3 column dashboard](screenshots/Dashboard-aaa-Original.png)
![Compacted jira 3 column dashboard](screenshots/Dashboard-aaa-Compact.png)

Please note - **even more rows and columns in widgets tables - scrolling dissapeared**.

2) Jira 2 column dashboard (ba layout):
![Original jira 2 column (second wide) dashboard](screenshots/Dashboard-ba-Original.png)
![Compacted jira 2 column (second wide) dashboard](screenshots/Dashboard-ba-Compact.png)

*Unfortunately there one implementation details quirk: Widgets at right must be at colors 5 (blue - #003366), 6(violet - #3C78B5) or 7 (grey - #bbbbbb). Otherwise you may just change style*.

3) Issues and its list (search, filter).
![List of issues original look](screenshots/List-of-issues-Original.png)
![List of issues compact view](screenshots/List-of-issues-Conmpact.png)

You may see several enhansments here:
* Issue details from center moved to right. So, yuo start read from problem, meta information also at top right.
* Left list do not truncate issue summary at half of word - instead multiline used.
* If you use [Threaded comments plugin](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.jira.threadedcomments.threaded-comments) there are also few changes - compactnes, highlight odd lines and fir like/dislike bug appearence as a bonus.
